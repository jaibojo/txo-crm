Subject: Quick request - referral to {old_company_name}

Hi {spoc_name},

Hope all is well at {new_company_name}!

Since you've moved on from {old_company_name}, I wanted to ask if you could introduce us to your replacement or the current hiring manager there.

We had great success working together on {roles_worked}, and I'd love to continue that relationship with your former team.

Would you be comfortable making an introduction?

Thanks so much!

Best regards,
[Your Name]
