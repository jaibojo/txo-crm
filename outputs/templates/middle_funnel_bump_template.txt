Subject: Re: {previous_subject} - checking back in

Hi {spoc_name},

I wanted to follow up on our conversation from {last_contact_date} about {topic}.

I know timing wasn't right back then, but I wanted to reconnect because:

Since we last spoke, we've:
- {growth_metric_1}
- {growth_metric_2}
- {growth_metric_3}

Given these improvements and your {season/quarter} planning, would it make sense to revisit the conversation?

Happy to jump on a quick call if you're open to it.

Best regards,
